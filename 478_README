Goomba 478 README
*****************

Project Name: Goomba, the Javascript Game Engine
Team Members: Taggart Ashby

"Compilation and Creation": Because my project is an engine in Javascript, there is no compilation or creation, and you can't "run" it.

The most in-depth and up-to-date information for using the Goomba Engine is available at: https://github.com/tgashby/Goomba#readme

Example games and code will be posted at: https://github.com/tgashby/Goomba/tree/master/examples

As a very brief overview, you will need 2-3 files to get a game running with Goomba:
1. An HTML file to set up the web-page.
	Here's an example:
		<!DOCTYPE html>
		<head>
			<script type="text/javascript" src="goomba.js"></script>
		</head>
		<body>
			<script type="text/javascript" src="mygame.js"></script>
		</body>

2. The goomba.js file, available in this folder or most up to date at: https://github.com/tgashby/Goomba

3. Your own game file, called "mygame.js" in the HTML example, but the name of the file is unimportant. This file will use the Goomba Engine to create your game.
